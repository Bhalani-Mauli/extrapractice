# NPM

1. What is npm project ?
- Npm project means we initialise the project by `npm init` and then give basic detail 
and it will create a package.json file and it has some project information and project dependency information.
and also the command by which you can run the project and many more..

2. WHy we use it ?
- Because if we want to send the project to someone then we need to tell them what things you need to install and
which is dependency that they need to install.But For npm project it makes it easy to use by the whole team .
- For ex 
     we can send the project to anyone and he/she just need to press one command `npm install` and node will install
     all the dependencies that are specified in package.json file and after that he can use command `npm run start` (in our case there are some problem with your installation but it works in other cases)
     or you can give any name in package.json
