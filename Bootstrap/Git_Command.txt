__________________________
changing branch 

There are 2 ways 

command line
GUI

1. git checkout BRANCHNAME
2. in vs code at bottom corner (left) you can see the branch name .click on it and change the branch

Note If you want to change the branch and if you are unable to change the branch then you can  either stash your changes or you can  commit it and push it 
FOr ex.
1. we have 1 change here and now we change the branch to master (git checkout master)
2. git stash (it will save your all task in one temp file)
3. when you want to get back those changes then type git stash pop and you will have ur changes


-------------------
everything that starts with 
origin/xyz are remote branches means that are in github
if you created a branch but havaent pushed it then thats local branch

to delete a branch 
git branch -d "name of branch"
small d is for local and capital is for remote delete
careful with this command
