1. name of the files/ variable should be meaningful (most important)
2. form starting(main) page you can use index.js
3. never use page1 page2 , project1 project3,... use apropriate name
4. Project should Look clean and by reading the name of the folder/file one should understand
 the meaning of the file/folder

 for ex. by the name commons we can understand that common files should be there
 and we are using it at various places
 lets see

 so we see it in almost every file 

5.components has seperate folders and by each folders name you can understand whats there inside.
6. we have one base html file from where you can copy the basic template so you dont need to write it
again and again
7. we have resources folder where we can put static file like image and anything else
